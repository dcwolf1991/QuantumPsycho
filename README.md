# Quantum Psycho

INTRODUCTION

This project serves to research my thesis question where I try to find out how AI-generated resources influence the creative workflow and how the creator himself remains creative or just a curator during the development process. In these questions, I try to find out where the boundary is that once crossed, creativity and human touch are lost, and what influences it.

A dynamic, fast-paced shooter where you and your partner must navigate a city engulfed in chaos due to a massive cyber-attack. This attack has caused nearly all MaxTac agents a Cyberpsychosis. (ironically)  

As one of the few unaffected, your task, along with your partner and guidance from your training officer, is to resolve this crisis by any means necessary. Adding to the mayhem, a laboratory's biological experiments have escaped, attacking anything alive in sight.
